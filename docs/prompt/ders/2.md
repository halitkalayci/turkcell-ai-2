User: Which API versioning would you recommend for this project?

Route, Query, Header etc.?

GitHub Copilot: I'll analyze the current project setup and OpenAPI contracts to provide a versioning recommendation.

Based on your project guidelines and current setup, I recommend **URI Path Versioning** (e.g., `/api/v1/orders`).

## Why Path Versioning?

1. **Already Mandated**: AGENTS.md explicitly requires: *"API Changes MUST be versioned. (eg. `api/v1/orders`, `/api/v2/orders`) - Version MUST be placed in path."*

2. **Best for Microservices**: 
   - Clear service boundaries
   - Easy routing/gateway configuration
   - Simple cache management
   - Visible in Swagger UI

3. **Client-Friendly**:
   - Version immediately visible in URL
   - No custom headers to remember
   - Easy to test with curl/Postman
   - Browser-accessible

4. **Spring Boot Native**: Simple to implement with `@RequestMapping("/api/v1")`

## Current State vs. Recommended

**Current**: OrderController.java uses `/orders`

**Should be**: `/api/v1/orders`

## Why NOT Other Options?

- **Query params** (`/orders?version=1`): Optional nature leads to errors, complicates routing
- **Headers** (`Accept: application/vnd.api.v1+json`): Hidden from URLs, harder to test, not cache-friendly
- **Content negotiation**: Overly complex for this scale

Path versioning aligns with your contract-first approach and microservices architecture.
