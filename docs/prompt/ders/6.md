User: order-service.yaml has changed. Scan the changes and implement/refactor changes in controllers if needed.

GitHub Copilot: I'll scan the order-service.yaml file and compare it with the current controller implementation to identify any needed changes.

Let me read the rest of the OpenAPI spec to see all the schemas:

Perfect! Now I've reviewed both the OpenAPI spec and the controller. Let me compare them to check alignment:

**Analysis:**
1. ✅ **Endpoints** - All 4 endpoints match perfectly:
   - `POST /api/v1/orders` (createOrder)
   - `GET /api/v1/orders/{id}` (getOrderById)
   - `POST /api/v1/orders/{id}/cancel` (cancelOrder)
   - `PATCH /api/v1/orders/{id}/status` (updateOrderStatus)

2. ✅ **Request/Response Models** - All DTOs are properly referenced
3. ✅ **HTTP Status Codes** - Properly implemented (201 for create, 200 for others)
4. ✅ **Annotations** - All OpenAPI annotations match the spec
5. ✅ **Operation IDs** - Match exactly
6. ✅ **Parameters** - UUID path parameters properly defined
7. ✅ **Validation** - `@Valid` annotation present for request bodies

**Conclusion:** The controller implementation is **fully aligned** with the OpenAPI specification. No changes are needed.

The OrderController.java is already fully compliant with the order-service.yaml contract. All endpoints, request/response models, HTTP methods, status codes, and OpenAPI annotations match the specification perfectly.

No refactoring or implementation changes are required.
