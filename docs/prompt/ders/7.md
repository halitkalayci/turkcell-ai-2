User: Generate a prompt using our default pattern. This prompt MUST implement new inventory-service by our rules.

GitHub Copilot: I'll generate a prompt for implementing the inventory-service following your default pattern. Let me first examine the prompt templates and the inventory-service contract.

Now let me check the rest of the inventory-service.yaml file and examine the order-service structure to understand the implementation pattern: 

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/PC1/Desktop/Projects/Education/Java/turkcell-ai-2/docs/openapi/inventory-service.yaml#500-500), lines 500 to 580

Read [](file:///c%3A/Users/PC1/Desktop/Projects/Education/Java/turkcell-ai-2/order-service/pom.xml#1-1), lines 1 to 50

Now let me create the prompt file: 

Created [](file:///c%3A/Users/PC1/Desktop/Projects/Education/Java/turkcell-ai-2/docs/prompt/implement-inventory-service.md)

I've generated a comprehensive prompt following your R-C-T-C-O-E pattern at implement-inventory-service.md.

The prompt includes:

**ROLE**: Senior Backend Java Engineer specializing in Spring Boot + contract-first development

**CONTEXT**: Mini e-commerce platform with Java 21, Spring Boot 3.2.1, contract-first using OpenAPI, with the inventory-service.yaml contract as the source of truth

**TASK**: Complete implementation plan with 6 batched steps covering all layers (entities, repositories, DTOs, services, controllers, exceptions, config)

**CONSTRAINTS**: 
- MUST NOT invent anything beyond the contract
- MUST use exact HTTP codes and RFC 7807 error format
- MUST NOT add new dependencies
- MUST implement idempotency, TTL, and proper business rules

**OUTPUT**: 
- File breakdown plan (wait for approval)
- 6 implementation batches (foundation → domain → DTOs → exceptions → service → controller)
- Verification matrix with test suggestions

**EXAMPLES**: Three practical curl-based examples demonstrating:
- Idempotent reservation requests
- Insufficient stock error handling (422)
- Reservation expiration flow

The prompt enforces your contract-first philosophy and ensures no invention, following the exact structure of order-service as a reference.
