## 1) HOW TO WORK (MANDATORY WORKFLOW)

### 1.1 Plan-first, then code

Before generating code, you MUST:

- Confirm the relevant contract(s) exist and match the request. (OpenAPI)

- Propose a FILE BREAKDOWN (what files will be created/changed + why)

- Ask QUESTIONS for missing details instead of guessing.

- Generate codes in batches which are connected. (or in small batches of max 3 files)

### 1.2 No Inventing

You MUST NOT invent:

- endpoints, request/response fields, error models

- event names/payloads

- DB schema/columns

- Business rules

If any detail is missing, ASK.
